# Network Vulnerability Scanner

This is a Python script that uses the `nmap` network scanner to identify vulnerabilities in specified targets. It supports TCP SYN scan, UDP scan, and TCP connect scan.

## How to Use

1. **Run the script:** You can run this script on any system with Python installed. Navigate to the directory containing the script and type `python filename.py` in your terminal or command prompt, replacing `filename.py` with the actual name of your script.

2. **Enter target(s):** When prompted, enter the IP address(es) of the target machine(s). If there are multiple targets, separate them with commas. The script also supports CIDR notation for subnet scanning.

3. **Specify ports:** Next, specify the port(s) to be scanned. If there are multiple ports, separate them with commas. You can also specify a range, such as 22-443.

4. **Choose scan type:** Choose the type of scan you want to perform. Enter 1 for TCP SYN scan, 2 for UDP scan, or 3 for TCP connect scan.

5. **View results:** The script will display the number of vulnerabilities found. It will also log the date and time of the scan, the target, and the number of vulnerabilities found in a file named `log.txt`.
